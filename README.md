# ‚ö†Ô∏è SSD Stress Destroyer Tool ‚ö†Ô∏è

**WARNING: THIS IS A DANGEROUS TOOL THAT WILL PHYSICALLY DAMAGE STORAGE DEVICES**

## üìå Description
This script performs aggressive write operations designed to:
- Rapidly wear down SSD/NAND flash cells
- Test storage endurance under extreme conditions
- Demonstrate flash memory degradation mechanisms

## ‚ò†Ô∏è What This Actually Does
1. **Parallel sequential writes** - Maximizes write throughput
2. **4K random writes** - Most damaging pattern for NAND flash
3. **Direct device hammering** - Bypasses some wear-leveling
4. **Continuous operation** - Prevents garbage collection
## üöÄ How to Run
# 1. Install required tools
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y fio

# 2. Download the script
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PringelsDC/ssd-destroyer/main/sedo.sh
chmod +x sedo.sh
## üîç Identify target Device
# List all available disks (BE VERY CAREFUL HERE!)
lsblk -o NAME,MODEL,SIZE,SERIAL,MOUNTPOINT

## üí• Exeute
# Run with absolute certainty you've selected the correct device
sudo ./sedo.sh
## üî• Damage Potential
- Consumer SSDs may fail within **hours/days**
- Enterprise SSDs may last **days/weeks**
- Permanent data loss occurs immediately
- Warranty voiding is certain

## ‚öñÔ∏è Legal & Ethical Warning
```diff
- DO NOT RUN ON ANY SYSTEM YOU DON'T OWN
- DO NOT USE ON EMPLOYER/SCHOOL/HOSTED HARDWARE
- DO NOT USE TO CIRCUMVENT DATA RETENTION POLICIES
- THIS CONSTITUTES WILLFUL DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY IN MANY JURISDICTIONS

# Physical airgap recommended
# Disconnect all other drives
# Triple-check device identifier
# Run in disposable environment

+ By using this software, you accept:
+ 1. All risk of data loss
+ 2. Complete responsibility for outcomes
+ 3. That the author bears zero liability
